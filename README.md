# Yelp Review Using APIs
Yelp Reviews using Yelp API and Google Vision API
>I used .NET Blazor to build this project.

## Project Description

This app pulls the 3 latest reviews from Yelp for the Cheecake Factory in Murray, Utah.
This app also takes the user's profile image and runs it through Google Vision's API to read the possible emotions of the face detected in the image. 
>Yelp Business limits the return of reviews to 3, and I didn't spend much time searching for a workaround.


## How to Install and Run the Project
1. Open Visual Studio on your local machine
2. Choose "Clone a respository" and clone this repo
3. Once Visual Studio has loaded the solution, run the solution. 
VS will build and execute the file, which will open in a new browser.
